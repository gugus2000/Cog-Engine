	"description": "A cog which allows an administrator of the server to define rules for his server. A rule is defined by an event, which will trigger the rule, conditions, which will be checked, and lastly events, which will be executed if all the conditions are checked. Concretely, this allows you, for example, to automatically ban, mute someone who has a bad nickname. It can also be used to send message at join, or even make reaction role (it is not optimized for that)",
